## RL Core Concepts

### The Core Loop: Markov Decision Process (MDP)

| RL Concept | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Environment** | The simulator (Isaac Sim). It holds the world state and responds to actions. |
| **Agent (Policy)** | A neural network that decides what to do. It sends actions and receives observations + reward. |
| **Observation** | What the agent sees: joint angles, velocities, IMU data, foot contacts. A vector of floats. |
| **Action** | What the agent does: target joint positions, velocities, or torques. Also a vector of floats. |
| **Reward** | A single number telling the agent how good its last action was. Positive = good, negative = bad. |
| **Episode** | One attempt from start to termination (robot falls, timeout reached). |
| **Policy** | The learned function mapping observations to actions. Starts random, gets better through training. |
| **Training** | Millions of episodes where the policy is gradually improved based on which actions led to higher rewards. |

The **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is the formal framework: at each timestep, the agent
observes state `s`, takes action `a`, receives reward `r`, and transitions to new state `s'`.
The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over an episode.

```
 +----------+     action      +--------------+
 |  Agent   | -------------> |  Environment |
 |  (Policy)|                | (Isaac Sim)  |
 |          | <------------- |              |
 +----------+   observation  +--------------+
                + reward
```

### Why RL Is Hard (Honest Assessment)

RL is not like supervised learning. In supervised learning, you have labeled data and clear
loss functions. In RL:

- **No labels.** The agent must discover good behavior through trial and error.
- **Sparse signal.** The reward might be zero for thousands of steps before something useful happens.
- **Credit assignment.** If the robot falls at step 500, which of the 500 actions caused it?
- **Non-stationary.** The data distribution changes as the policy improves.
- **Reward design is an art.** A bad reward function trains a bad policy, even if training "succeeds."

Humanoid locomotion is among the hardest RL tasks because bipedal balance is inherently unstable
(unlike wheeled robots), the action space is high-dimensional (20+ joints), and small errors
compound quickly (one bad joint command and the robot falls).

Expect: weeks of iteration on reward functions, hyperparameters, and domain randomization before
getting a walking policy that transfers to real hardware.

## Isaac Ecosystem Overview

NVIDIA has several overlapping tools. Here is what each one does and which to use.

### Isaac Sim vs Isaac Lab vs Isaac Gym

| Tool | What It Is | Status | Use When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Isaac Sim** | Full robot simulator built on Omniverse. Renders photorealistic scenes, simulates physics (PhysX 5), supports cameras, LiDAR, IMU. | Active, primary simulator | You need sensor simulation (camera, LiDAR), photorealistic rendering, or complex scene building. |
| **Isaac Lab** | RL framework built on top of Isaac Sim. Provides environment abstractions, vectorized simulation, reward/observation APIs. Successor to Isaac Gym. | Active, primary RL framework | You are training RL policies. This is your main tool. |
| **Isaac Gym** (legacy) | Standalone GPU-accelerated RL environment. Pioneered massively parallel simulation. | Deprecated, replaced by Isaac Lab | Do not start new projects with Isaac Gym. Migrate to Isaac Lab. |
| **Omniverse** | Platform layer providing USD scene management, RTX rendering, and extension system. Isaac Sim is an Omniverse app. | Active, underlying platform | You need to create custom extensions or integrate with other Omniverse tools. |

**Bottom line:** Use **Isaac Lab** for RL training. It runs on top of Isaac Sim
and gives you everything needed for humanoid locomotion training.

## Which RL Algorithm?

For robotics locomotion, three algorithms dominate. Here is when to use each.

| Algorithm | Type | Best For | Pros | Cons | Use This When |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PPO** | On-policy, actor-critic | Locomotion, manipulation, most robotics tasks | Stable, forgiving hyperparameters, works well with parallel envs | Sample-inefficient (needs millions of steps), on-policy = can't reuse old data | **Default choice.** Start here. Most Isaac Lab examples use PPO. |
| **SAC** | Off-policy, actor-critic | Tasks requiring sample efficiency, continuous control | Sample-efficient, automatic entropy tuning, reuses past experience | More hyperparameters to tune, can be unstable with parallel envs | You have limited compute or need faster iteration. Less common for locomotion. |
| **TD3** | Off-policy, actor-critic | Continuous control, when SAC's entropy is problematic | Addresses overestimation bias, deterministic policy | Requires careful tuning, less explored for humanoid tasks | SAC doesn't work for your specific task. Rare choice for locomotion. |

**Recommendation for Unitree G1 locomotion: Start with PPO.** The Isaac Lab ecosystem, research
papers, and community examples overwhelmingly use PPO for humanoid walking. Switch to SAC only
if you have a specific reason (limited GPU time, need sample efficiency).

---

## Training Workflow Overview

This is the end-to-end workflow for training a locomotion policy:

```
1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP
   Define observation space, action space, scene
   "What does the robot see? What can it do?"
        |
        v
2. REWARD DESIGN
   Define reward components and weights
   "What behavior do we want to encourage/discourage?"
        |
        v
3. DOMAIN RANDOMIZATION
   Randomize physics, sensors, terrain
   "Make training harder so the policy generalizes"
        |
        v
4. TRAINING
   Run PPO for millions of steps across thousands of parallel envs
   "Let the policy learn through trial and error"
        |
        v
5. EVALUATION
   Test trained policy in simulation
   "Does it walk? Does it handle perturbations?"
        |
        v
6. ITERATION
   Adjust rewards, randomization, hyperparameters
   "Training rarely works on the first try"
        |
        v
7. SIM-TO-REAL TRANSFER
   Deploy to Unitree G1 hardware
   "Does the learned behavior work on the real robot?"
```

Each step has its own reference file with detailed guidance. The most time will be spent
in the **Reward Design <--> Training <--> Evaluation** loop (steps 2-6).

## Common RL Failure Diagnosis

When training goes wrong (it will), use this table to diagnose the issue.

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Action |
|---|---|---|
| Reward stays flat at zero | Reward function is too sparse; agent never accidentally gets reward | Add dense reward shaping (e.g., reward for moving forward even slightly). See `references/rl-training.md` |
| Reward increases then crashes to zero | Learning rate too high; policy updates too aggressive | Reduce learning rate by 2-5x; reduce PPO clip range from 0.2 to 0.1 |
| Reward increases but robot walks weird | Reward hacking: agent found an exploit (e.g., sliding on knees) | Add penalty terms (energy, smoothness, joint limit). See `references/isaac-lab-envs.md` |
| Robot falls immediately every episode | Action scale too large; observation missing critical info (e.g., no IMU) | Check action space scaling; verify observations include orientation and angular velocity |
| Training is extremely slow | Too few parallel environments; GPU underutilized | Increase num_envs (try 4096); check GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi` |
| Policy works in sim, fails on real robot | Sim-to-real gap: physics/sensors differ from reality | Increase domain randomization; add actuator modeling. See `references/sim-to-real.md` |
| Loss is NaN | Observation or reward contains inf/NaN; numerical instability | Add observation clipping; check for division by zero in reward |
| Agent spins in circles | Reward doesn't penalize deviation from heading; reward for velocity but not direction | Add heading reward component or directional velocity reward |
| Robot stands but never walks | Standing is a local optimum (standing = no fall penalty, no negative reward) | Add forward velocity reward that outweighs the safety of standing still |
| Training converges but performance is mediocre | Suboptimal hyperparameters or reward weights | Try curriculum learning: start easy, progressively harder. See `references/rl-training.md` |

## GPU Requirements and Cloud Options

RL training for humanoid locomotion is GPU-intensive. Here are practical guidelines.

### Minimum Hardware

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU | RTX 3070 (8 GB VRAM) | RTX 4090 (24 GB VRAM) | More VRAM = more parallel environments |
| CPU | 8 cores | 16+ cores | Data processing between GPU steps |
| RAM | 32 GB | 64 GB | Isaac Sim is memory-hungry |
| Disk | 50 GB free (SSD) | 100 GB+ NVMe | Isaac Sim installation is ~30 GB |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 | Windows works but Linux is primary target |

### Parallel Environments vs VRAM

| VRAM | Approx. Max Envs (Humanoid) | Training Speed |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | ~512 | Slow, but usable for initial experiments |
| 12 GB | ~1024 | Reasonable for development |
| 24 GB | ~4096 | Good training speed |
| 48 GB (A6000) | ~8192+ | Fast training, production runs |
| 80 GB (A100/H100) | ~16384+ | Research-grade speed |

### Cloud GPU Options

| Provider | GPU | Approx. Cost/hr | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lambda Labs** | A100 80GB | $1.10-2.00 | Cheapest A100s, popular for RL research |
| **Vast.ai** | RTX 4090 / A100 | $0.30-1.50 | Marketplace pricing, variable availability |
| **AWS** | A10G (g5), A100 (p4d) | $1.00-32.00 | Reliable but expensive; p4d instances for serious training |
| **GCP** | A100, H100 | $2.00-8.00 | Good availability; use preemptible for cost savings |
| **Azure** | A100, H100 | $2.00-8.00 | Similar to GCP |
| **RunPod** | RTX 4090 / A100 | $0.40-2.00 | Simple interface, good for spot instances |

**Recommendation:** Start local with whatever NVIDIA GPU you have (even a 3060 works for
small experiments with ~256 envs). Move to cloud (Lambda Labs or Vast.ai) when you need
4096+ environments for serious training runs.

## Training Time Estimates (Humanoid Locomotion)

These are rough estimates for training a walking policy from scratch with PPO:

| Envs | GPU | Wall Time to Basic Walking | Wall Time to Robust Walking |
|---|---|---|---|
| 512 | RTX 3070 | 8-16 hours | 24-48 hours |
| 2048 | RTX 4090 | 2-4 hours | 8-16 hours |
| 4096 | RTX 4090 | 1-2 hours | 4-8 hours |
| 4096 | A100 | 30-60 min | 2-4 hours |

"Basic walking" = moves forward without falling. "Robust walking" = handles pushes, terrain,
speed changes. These numbers assume a reasonable reward function and hyperparameters; bad
design can make training take 10x longer or never converge.

```
my_locomotion/
+-- __init__.py
+-- config/
|   +-- __init__.py
|   +-- g1_walking.py          # Environment config (obs, actions, rewards, scene)

```

See `references/isaac-lab-envs.md` for the full environment class structure and
`references/rl-training.md` for training configuration details.

## Reward Design Quick Reference

Reward design is the make-or-break skill in RL. Here are battle-tested patterns for
locomotion tasks.

### The Reward Equation

A locomotion reward function is typically a weighted sum of components:

```python
reward = (
    w1 * velocity_tracking      # Are we going where commanded?
    + w2 * alive_bonus           # Are we still standing?
    - w3 * energy_penalty        # Are we wasting energy?
    - w4 * smoothness_penalty    # Are we being jerky?
    - w5 * orientation_penalty   # Are we leaning too much?
)
```

### Reward Design Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Exponential tracking** | Rewarding velocity/position tracking | `exp(-||v_actual - v_target||^2 / sigma)` |
| **L2 penalty** | Penalizing unwanted quantities | `-||joint_torques||^2` |
| **Threshold bonus** | Rewarding binary conditions | `+0.5 if base_height > 0.6` |
| **Delta penalty** | Penalizing change rate | `-||action_t - action_{t-1}||^2` |
| **Cosine similarity** | Rewarding directional alignment | `dot(velocity, heading) / ||velocity||` |

### Iteration Strategy

1. **Start simple.** Begin with only velocity tracking + alive bonus + energy penalty.
2. **Add penalties one at a time.** When you see a specific bad behavior, add a targeted penalty.
3. **Watch for reward hacking after each change.** The agent will try to exploit the new reward.
4. **Log individual reward components.** Don't just look at total reward -- understand which
   components are driving behavior.
5. **Visual inspection is essential.** Numbers can lie. Watch the robot move in simulation.

## Debugging Checklist

When something goes wrong, work through this checklist in order:

### Environment Not Loading

- [ ] Is Isaac Sim installed correctly? Run `python -c "from isaacsim import SimulationApp"`
- [ ] Is Isaac Lab installed? Run `python -c "import omni.isaac.lab"`
- [ ] Are GPU drivers up to date? Run `nvidia-smi`
- [ ] Is there enough disk space? Isaac Sim needs ~30 GB free
- [ ] Is the URDF/USD model accessible at the configured path?

### Training Not Starting

- [ ] Is the task registered? Run `python -c "import gymnasium as gym; print([s for s in gym.registry.keys() if 'G1' in s])"`
- [ ] Do observation dimensions match the policy network input?
- [ ] Do action dimensions match the policy network output?
- [ ] Are all reward functions returning tensors of shape `(num_envs,)`?
- [ ] Is `num_envs` small enough for your GPU VRAM?

### Training Started But No Learning

- [ ] Is the reward function correct? Print reward components individually
- [ ] Are observations normalized? Check observation magnitudes (should be roughly [-5, 5])
- [ ] Is the action scale appropriate? Actions of 0.25 rad offset are a good starting point
- [ ] Is the learning rate reasonable? Try 1e-3 first
- [ ] Are there enough environments? Try at least 2048 for stable learning
- [ ] Is the episode length long enough? At least 10 seconds for locomotion

### Policy Learned But Behavior Is Wrong

- [ ] Is there reward hacking? Watch the robot in play mode with 16 envs
- [ ] Are reward weights balanced? No single component should dominate
- [ ] Is there a missing penalty? Common: knee contact, excessive base motion, foot sliding
- [ ] Does the observation include all needed info? Missing projected gravity = can't balance

## Key Terminology Quick Reference

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Articulation** | A robot model with joints in Isaac Sim. The G1 is an articulation with 23 DoF. |
| **DoF** | Degrees of freedom. Number of independent joints the robot can control. |
| **Rollout** | One episode of the agent interacting with the environment. |
| **Trajectory** | The sequence of (state, action, reward) tuples in a rollout. |
| **GAE** | Generalized Advantage Estimation. A technique to reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. |
| **Clip range** | PPO parameter controlling how much the policy can change per update. |
| **Entropy** | Measure of policy randomness. Higher entropy = more exploration. |
| **Curriculum** | Gradually increasing task difficulty during training. |
| **Proprioception** | Sensing the robot's own body state (joint positions, velocities, orientation). No cameras. |
| **Exteroception** | Sensing the external world (cameras, LiDAR). Adds complexity. |
