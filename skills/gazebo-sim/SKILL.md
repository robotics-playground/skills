## What Is Gazebo Harmonic?

Gazebo Harmonic (also called Gazebo 8 or "new Gazebo") is the current LTS release of the
Gazebo simulator, part of the rewritten Gazebo project (formerly Ignition). It replaced
"Gazebo Classic" (the `gazebo` command) which reached end-of-life in January 2025.

### Key Differences from Classic Gazebo

| Aspect | Classic Gazebo (`gazebo`) | Gazebo Harmonic (`gz sim`) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Command | `gazebo`, `gzserver`, `gzclient` | `gz sim`, `gz sim -s` (server), `gz sim -g` (GUI) |
| Model format | SDF + URDF with `<gazebo>` tags | SDF preferred; URDF supported via automatic conversion |
| Transport | Gazebo Transport (custom) | gz-transport (DDS-like, separate from ROS 2 DDS) |
| ROS bridge | `gazebo_ros_pkgs` | `ros_gz_bridge`, `ros_gz_sim`, `ros_gz_image` |
| Plugin API | `ModelPlugin`, `WorldPlugin`, etc. | `System` interface with `ISystemConfigure`, `ISystemPreUpdate`, etc. |
| Physics | ODE (default), Bullet, DART, Simbody | DART (default), Bullet, TPE |
| Topic CLI | `gz topic` (classic) | `gz topic` (new, different API) |
| Environment var | `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` | `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` |

**If you see `gazebo` commands or `gazebo_ros` packages in a tutorial, it is for Classic Gazebo
and will NOT work with Harmonic.** Always look for `gz sim` commands and `ros_gz_*` packages.

## Architecture Overview

Gazebo Harmonic is built from modular libraries. Understanding this architecture helps when
debugging issues or choosing which component to configure.

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|   gz-sim         |     |   gz-gui         |     |   gz-launch      |
|   (simulation    |     |   (3D viewer,    |     |   (launch system, |
|    orchestrator) |     |    GUI plugins)  |     |    ERB templates) |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+     +------------------+
         |                        |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
|   gz-physics     |     |   gz-rendering   |
|   (DART, Bullet, |     |   (OGRE 2.x,     |
|    TPE engines)  |     |    scene graph)   |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
         |                        |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
|   gz-sensors     |     |   gz-transport   |
|   (IMU, LiDAR,   |     |   (pub/sub,      |
|    camera, etc.) |     |    services)     |
+------------------+     +------------------+
```

| Library | What it does | When you care about it |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **gz-sim** | Coordinates physics, sensors, rendering each step | Always -- this is the core |
| **gz-physics** | Runs physics (DART, Bullet, TPE) | Tuning step size, solver iterations, contact parameters |
| **gz-rendering** | Renders the 3D scene (OGRE 2.x) | Camera/depth sensors, GPU ray, visual appearance |
| **gz-sensors** | Simulates sensor behavior and noise | Adding IMU, LiDAR, camera to your robot |
| **gz-transport** | Pub/sub messaging within Gazebo | Bridging to ROS 2, gz topic CLI |
| **gz-gui** | Qt-based GUI, visualization plugins | Debugging visualization, adding GUI panels |
| **gz-launch** | Launch system with ERB templates | Starting complex simulations (prefer ROS 2 launch instead) |

## SDF vs URDF: Which Format for Simulation?

| Criteria | SDF | URDF |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Native to Gazebo?** | Yes -- first-class support | Converted to SDF internally |
| **Sensor definitions** | Full support in `<sensor>` tags | Requires `<gazebo>` extension blocks |
| **Plugin attachment** | Clean `<plugin>` tags in model | Via `<gazebo reference="link_name">` extensions |
| **World definition** | Yes -- can define entire worlds | No -- robot-only format |
| **ROS 2 `robot_description`** | Not supported by `robot_state_publisher` | Native format for ROS 2 toolchain |
| **Visual/collision separation** | Full control per link | Full control per link |
| **Reusable includes** | `<include>` tag for model composition | `xacro` for macro-based composition |

### Decision Guide

```
Do you need robot_state_publisher / MoveIt / Nav2?
+-- YES --> Use URDF (with xacro) for the robot description
|           Add <gazebo> extension blocks for sensors and plugins
|           ros_gz_sim will convert URDF to SDF at spawn time
|
+-- NO ---> Is this a world file (environment, not robot)?
            +-- YES --> Use SDF (worlds are SDF-only)
            +-- NO ---> Use SDF for Gazebo-only models, URDF if ROS tools needed
```

**Practical recommendation:** Use URDF+xacro for robot models (so they work with the full
ROS 2 toolchain) and SDF for world files. This is the most common pattern in the ROS 2
ecosystem.

## Common Physics Issues Diagnosis

When something goes wrong in simulation, it is almost always a physics configuration problem.
Here are the most common symptoms and their fixes.

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Model sinks through floor | Missing `<collision>` element on a link | Add `<collision>` geometry to every link that should interact physically |
| Model sinks slowly | Mass too high for default contact parameters | Reduce mass, increase `<kp>` (contact stiffness), or decrease physics step size |
| Model flies away on spawn | Inertia values wildly wrong (e.g., all zeros or copy-paste error) | Recalculate inertia using `gz sdf --inertial-stats` or MeshLab |
| Joints explode / oscillate | Damping too low, step size too large, or conflicting joint limits | Increase `<damping>`, decrease `<max_step_size>`, check joint limits |
| Robot slides on flat ground | Friction coefficients too low | Increase `<mu>` and `<mu2>` in `<surface><friction>` |
| Robot vibrates in place | Physics step size too large for the mass/stiffness ratio | Decrease `<max_step_size>` to 0.0005 or lower |
| Tracked vehicle does not move | Diff-drive plugin on tracked vehicle | Use `TrackedVehicle` plugin instead of `DiffDrive` |
| Simulation runs but nothing moves | Model is `<static>true</static>` | Set `<static>false</static>` for dynamic models |
| Two models pass through each other | Both are `<static>true</static>` | Static-static collision is not computed; make at least one dynamic |

**The #1 beginner mistake:** Defining `<visual>` geometry but forgetting `<collision>` geometry.
The model looks fine but has no physical presence. Always define both.

---

## Sensor Plugin Selection Guide

Gazebo Harmonic includes built-in sensor plugins. You do not need to compile custom plugins
for standard sensors.

| Sensor | SDF `<sensor type="">` | Gazebo Topic Type | ROS 2 Message (via bridge) | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| IMU | `imu` | `gz.msgs.IMU` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` | Attach to robot base link |
| 2D LiDAR | `gpu_lidar` | `gz.msgs.LaserScan` | `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan` | GPU-accelerated, use for 2D scans |
| 3D LiDAR | `gpu_lidar` | `gz.msgs.PointCloudPacked` | `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` | Same plugin, multiple vertical rays |
| Camera (RGB) | `camera` | `gz.msgs.Image` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` | Set `<width>`, `<height>`, `<format>` |
| Depth Camera | `depth_camera` | `gz.msgs.Image` (depth) | `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` | Outputs 32-bit float depth image |
| RGBD Camera | `rgbd_camera` | `gz.msgs.Image` + depth | `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` x2 | Combined color + depth |
| Contact Sensor | `contact` | `gz.msgs.Contacts` | `gazebo_msgs/msg/ContactsState` | Requires `<collision>` element name |
| Altimeter | `altimeter` | `gz.msgs.Altimeter` | `sensor_msgs/msg/FluidPressure` | Height above ground |
| Magnetometer | `magnetometer` | `gz.msgs.Magnetometer` | `sensor_msgs/msg/MagneticField` | Simulated compass |
| Air Pressure | `air_pressure` | `gz.msgs.FluidPressure` | `sensor_msgs/msg/FluidPressure` | Barometric pressure |

### Adding Noise to Sensors

All sensors support Gaussian noise configuration. Always add noise for realistic simulation:

```xml
<sensor name="imu_sensor" type="imu">
  <always_on>true</always_on>
  <update_rate>100</update_rate>
  <imu>
    <angular_velocity>
      <x><noise type="gaussian">
        <mean>0.0</mean>
        <stddev>0.01</stddev>
      </noise></x>
      <!-- repeat for y, z -->
    </angular_velocity>
    <linear_acceleration>
      <x><noise type="gaussian">
        <mean>0.0</mean>
        <stddev>0.1</stddev>
      </noise></x>
      <!-- repeat for y, z -->
    </linear_acceleration>
  </imu>
</sensor>
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

Simulation performance is measured by **Real-Time Factor (RTF)**. An RTF of 1.0 means the
simulation runs at real-world speed. Below 1.0 means it is slower than real time.

### Quick Wins

| Optimization | Impact | How |
|-------------|--------|-----|
| Simplify collision geometry | High | Use primitives (box, cylinder, sphere) instead of mesh for collision |
| Reduce LiDAR ray count | High | Use fewer horizontal/vertical samples; 360 rays is usually enough for 2D |
| Lower camera resolution | Medium | Use 320x240 for development; increase for final testing only |
| Increase physics step size | Medium | `<max_step_size>0.002</max_step_size>` (default 0.001) -- but may reduce accuracy |
| Reduce sensor update rates | Medium | IMU at 100 Hz, LiDAR at 10 Hz, camera at 15 Hz is usually sufficient |
| Use headless mode | Medium | `gz sim -s` (server only, no GUI rendering) |
| Disable shadows | Low | In GUI settings or world SDF `<scene><shadows>false</shadows></scene>` |

### Performance Budget

For a single robot with sensors on a typical development machine:

| Component | Budget |
|-----------|--------|
| Physics (DART) | ~20% of step time |
| LiDAR (GPU ray) | ~30% of step time |
| Camera rendering | ~30% of step time |
| Sensor processing | ~10% of step time |
| Other (transport, etc.) | ~10% of step time |

If RTF drops below 0.5, check `gz sim --levels` output and consider reducing sensor fidelity
or switching to headless mode for algorithm development.

---

## Physics Engine Selection

| Engine | Best For | Limitations |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **DART** (default) | General robotics, articulated bodies, accurate contacts | Slower than Bullet for large scenes |
| **Bullet** | Large environments, many objects, gaming-style physics | Less accurate joint constraints |
| **TPE** (Trivial Physics Engine) | Non-physics testing, kinematic-only scenarios | No dynamics, no gravity, no collisions |

**Recommendation:** Start with DART (the default). Only switch to Bullet if you have
performance issues with many objects, or TPE if you only need kinematic motion for
testing sensor pipelines.

---

## Essential Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` | Additional model/world search paths | `export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$HOME/my_models:$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` |
| `GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH` | Custom plugin search paths | `export GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/my_plugins/lib` |
| `GZ_PARTITION` | Isolate Gazebo transport namespaces | `export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim` |
| `GZ_IP` | Network interface for multi-machine sim | `export GZ_IP=192.168.1.100` |
| `GZ_VERBOSE` | Log verbosity (0-4) | `export GZ_VERBOSE=3` |

## Common Gazebo Harmonic Packages (ROS 2)

Install these for ROS 2 Humble + Gazebo Harmonic integration:

```bash
# Core Gazebo Harmonic (if not installed with ROS)
sudo apt install gz-harmonic

# ROS 2 <-> Gazebo bridge packages (use your ROS 2 distro)
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz-bridge
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz-sim
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz-image

# Convenience metapackage
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz
```

**Version compatibility matrix:**

| ROS 2 Distro | Gazebo Version | Bridge Package |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Humble | Fortress (default) or Harmonic | `ros-humble-ros-gz` |
| Iron | Fortress or Harmonic | `ros-iron-ros-gz` |
| Jazzy | Harmonic (default) | `ros-jazzy-ros-gz` |

---

## Coordinate Systems and Units

Gazebo uses the **Z-up** coordinate convention and **metric** units throughout.

| Quantity | Unit | Convention |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Length | meters (m) | All dimensions, positions |
| Mass | kilograms (kg) | All mass values |
| Time | seconds (s) | Step size, rates |
| Angle | radians (rad) | Joint positions, orientations |
| Force | newtons (N) | Applied forces, contact forces |
| Torque | newton-meters (N*m) | Joint torques |
| Temperature | kelvin (K) | Thermal sensor |

### Pose Format

Poses in SDF use `<pose>x y z roll pitch yaw</pose>` where:
- x, y, z are position in meters
- roll, pitch, yaw are orientation in radians (Euler angles, intrinsic XYZ)

```xml
<!-- Model at x=1, y=2, z=0 with 90-degree rotation around Z -->
<pose>1.0 2.0 0.0 0 0 1.5708</pose>
```

      </link>
    </model>
  </world>
</sdf>
EOF

# 2. Launch it
gz sim /tmp/test_world.sdf

# 3. In the GUI, right-click to add shapes from the toolbar
# 4. Use gz topic -l in another terminal to see what is published
```

## Typical Workflow

```
1. Create/edit world SDF file
   --> See references/world-setup.md

2. Create/edit robot model (URDF or SDF)
   --> See references/robot-models.md

3. Write ROS 2 launch file to start Gazebo + spawn robot + bridge topics
   --> See references/ros2-integration.md

4. Run simulation, debug issues
   --> See references/debugging.md

5. Iterate: tune physics, add sensors, improve world
```
